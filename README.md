# ARRahman

A bunch of visualizations I did for potential inclusion in A.R. Rahman's 2015 World Tour. These didn't end up getting past the pitch phase, so we were allowed to offer the source for demo, production, or whatever else anyone would want to do with it.

These projects were written for intel cameras, but it should be trivial to port to kinect or any other depth camera, also, it the source may or may not build (again, it's mainly presented for reference), but if you need a specific build for demo or test, email me!
